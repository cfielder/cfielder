- 👋 Hi, I’m @cfielder, a post doc at the University of Arizona.
- 👀 I’m interested in studying the evolution of galaxies and the dark matter haloes in which they reside, particularly at the mass range of the Milky Way.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to analyze dwarf galaxies.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on most things!
- 📫 How to reach me: cef41@pitt.edu or cfielder@arizona.edu
